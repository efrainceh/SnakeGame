# Snake and Tacos

Java implementation of the popular SnakeGame, with tacos! A single player can play Adventure mode or versus a NPC. There is also the option for two players to go against one another and three speed settings.

### Mode Panel

- **One Player**: Normal mode where the player can continue to eat tacos and grow until there's a clash.
- **Two Player**: As for One player, but with two snakes controlled by different keys.
- **Adventure**: One player moves along five different maps of increased difficulty. Player moves to next map after 20 tacos.
- **NPC**: The NPC mode can only be added for the One Player mode. The NPC uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to the taco, and it moves at half the speed - otherwise it is basically unbeatable.
